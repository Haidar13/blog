            "content": "I am taking a Udaciy course for cloud native fundamentals and in the first lesson you need to install the following tools before continuing . Python | Git | Docker | Vagrant | VirtualBox | . I am using Windows 10 machine and there is a package manager called chocolatey (similar to apt and dnf in some linux distros) which I have been using for a while now. . To use it you need to run powershell as administrator (press WIN+S keys and search for powershell then run as administrator) . . If this is the first time using chocolatey you need to install it first . Copy the following code (from chocolatey website) . Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString(&#39;https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1&#39;)) . And past it into the PowerShell terminal then hit Enter . Note: the main command to run is . iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString(&#39;https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1&#39;)) . which will Invoke-Expression in the install.ps1 file after downloading it. the rest of the command is set the security policy for powershell to allow the downloaded powershell script to be executed. . After installing chocolatey, you can install all the requirements with this command . choco install python git docker-desktop vagrant virtualbox . You can also use choco upgrade PKG-NAME to upgrade a package. . You might also need to change the default WSL version to version 2 by issuing this command . wsl --set-default-version 2 . Another important thing, you need to check that virtualization is enabled from the BIOS/UEFI settings (this will depend on your computer model, you can search in your preferred search engine how to do this) . I use conda to manage my python environments, so I did not install python using chocolatey. I just started by installing the tools if I face something in the upcoming lessons I will update this post .",
